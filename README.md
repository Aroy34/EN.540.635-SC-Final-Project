## Description
This project involves the development of machine learning models to analyze and predict properties from a selected dataset. It includes implementations of a Neural Network and a Random Forest model, integrated into a main script that handles data processing, model training, and user interactions.

## Data
The data for the project is sourced from the `matminer` datasets, used for training both the Neural Network and Random Forest models.

## Codes

### main.py
The main script of the project, responsible for integrating various components. It handles user interactions, data processing, and model operations. It utilizes libraries like `torch`, `numpy`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib`, and orchestrates the workflow involving neural network and random forest models.

### neural_network.py
This script is dedicated to building, training, and evaluating a Neural Network model. It includes data preprocessing, model construction, training phases, and performance evaluation. Libraries such as `torch`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `sklearn` are used.

### random_forest.py
This script focuses on the Random Forest model. It handles data preprocessing, training, and evaluating the model's performance. It uses libraries like `pandas`, `sklearn`, and `matplotlib` and assesses the model using metrics like mean squared error and R2 score.

## Algorithm

### Neural Network
The Neural Network model uses layers, activation functions, and optimization techniques suitable for the data. Detailed implementation is in `neural_network.py`.

### Random Forest
The Random Forest model is implemented using sklearn's RandomForestRegressor, with detailed configuration and evaluation in `random_forest.py`.
